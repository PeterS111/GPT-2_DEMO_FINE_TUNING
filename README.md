# GPT-2 Base Fine-Tuning Demo
version 10.12.2020

The code is based on https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/Deep-Learning/ by Priyanka Dwivedi, with small changes by Peter S

This code allows to fine-tune GPT-2 Small and GPT-2 Medium and generate text from them.

To run the code go to GPT_2_DEMO_FINE_TUNING.ipynb and hit "Open in Colab".

If you want to run the models which were not fine-tuned (including the 1.5B GPT-2 XLarge) check out this repository:
